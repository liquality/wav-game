        Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement (the
        “Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It is part of your contract with
        Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY
        BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br></br> (a) <br></br> Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All
        claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable
        relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of
        any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved
        informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding
        arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration
        Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall
        be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the
        Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees,
        predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all
        authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods
        provided under the Terms.
        <br></br> (b) <br></br> Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute
        Resolution . Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must
        first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute ( “Notice” )
        describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the
        requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: add
        physical mail address of WavWRLD here. After the Notice is received, you
        and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.
        If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty
        (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an
        arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any
        party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator
        has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is
        entitled.
        <br></br> (c) <br></br> Arbitration Rules . This Agreement shall be
        governed by the laws of the State of New York. Any claim, dispute, or
        controversy (“Claim”) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
        the relationships among the parties hereto shall be resolved by one
        arbitrator through binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the
        expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration
        Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) as those Rules exist on the effective
        date of this Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules.
        The arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable.
        Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having
        jurisdiction. This clause is made pursuant to a transaction involving
        interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration
        Act. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided
        herein or for enforcement of this clause or of the arbitrator’s award;
        any such suit may be brought only in a Federal District Court or a New
        York state court located in New York County, New York. The arbitrator,
        and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive
        authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation,
        applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or
        formation of this Agreement including any claim that all or any part of
        the Agreement is void or voidable.
        <br></br> (d) <br></br> Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based
        Arbitration . If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the
        arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely
        on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party
        initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any
        personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed
        by the parties.
        <br></br> (e) <br></br> Time Limits. If you or the Company pursue
        arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded
        within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a
        claim) and within any deadline imposed under the Rules for the pertinent
        claim.
        <br></br> (f) <br></br> Authority of Arbitrator . If arbitration is
        initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if
        any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated
        with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The
        arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all
        or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award
        monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
        available to an individual under applicable law, the Rules, and the
        Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of
        decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the
        award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The
        arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis
        that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator
        is final and binding upon you and the Company.
        <br></br> (g) <br></br> Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE
        THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A
        TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims
        and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration
        Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more
        efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are
        subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation
        should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court
        in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU
        AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that
        the dispute be resolved by a judge.
        <br></br> (h) <br></br> Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions . ALL
        CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST
        BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS
        BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED
        OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR
        USER.
        <br></br> (i) <br></br> Confidentiality . All aspects of the arbitration
        proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and
        compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree
        to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This
        paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law
        any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an
        arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
        <br></br>(j) <br></br> Severability . If any part or parts of this
        Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or
        unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific
        part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and
        the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
        <br></br>(k) <br></br> Right to Waive. Any or all of the rights and
        limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the
        party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or
        affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
        <br></br>(l) <br></br> Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement
        will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.
        <br></br>(m) <br></br> Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in
        small claims court.
        <br></br>(n) <br></br> Emergency Equitable Relief . Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a
        state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending
        arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver
        of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
        <br></br>(o) <br></br> Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the
        Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of
        the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall
        not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
        <br></br>(p) <br></br> Courts. In any circumstances where the foregoing
        Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the
        parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the
        courts located within Kings County, New York, for such purpose

        you and us regarding the use of the Site and Services. Our failure to

        that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.
